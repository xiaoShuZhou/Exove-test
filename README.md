# Exove-test
For 1C. Create a slider in react: I used useState and useEffect hooks to implement the functionalities.

For 2A: I built an image browser allowing users to click images to browse them.

For 3B:
1. I Separated elements into three components: Image.js, ImageArea.js, and BigImage.
2. I implemented the dark mode: when the image is enlarged, there will be a "toggle dark mode" button on the right of the big image. Click the button to switch to dark mode.
3. Users can browse multiple images at the top of the web page.
